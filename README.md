## Professional Introduction  
I am a cybersecurity enthusiast with a background in Electrical and Computer Engineering and experience in machine learning, Python, and data analysis. I am currently an **Innovation Fellow student in Cybersecurity at The Knowledge House**, where I am gaining hands-on experience in security operations and cloud security. I am focused on developing skills in cloud security and threat detection, with the goal of building a career dedicated to protecting cloud environments, systems, and data.

## Cybersecurity Focus
My primary area of interest is **Cloud Security**, with emphasis on:

- Implementing secure configurations in cloud environments (AWS)
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) 
- Monitoring cloud resources for security risks and misconfigurations
- Protecting data in the cloud through encryption and access controls

## Security Foundations: Governance & Frameworks
### CIA Triad and AAA Framework 
The CIA Triad focuses on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Confidentiality ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals. Integrity focuses on keeping data accurate and intact, preventing unauthorized modification or destruction. Availability ensures that data and systems are accessible and usable by authorized individuals whenever needed.
The AAA Framework stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting. Authentication verifies the identity of users, Authorization determines which resources an authenticated user can access, and Accounting tracks and logs user activities for auditing and compliance.

## Security Philosophy

In my lab environment, the principles of the **CIA Triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability—**are actively applied through **virtualization and system isolation**. **Confidentiality** is ensured by running experiments in isolated virtual machines (VMs) UTM in my case and segmented networks, which prevent unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data. Additional measures such as strong authentication.

**Integrity** is maintained by using virtualization features such as snapshots, version control, and change tracking. These tools allow me to monitor, detect, and revert any unauthorized or accidental modifications to system files or configurations.  

**Availability** is supported through virtualization technologies that provide resource allocation, redundancy, and failover capabilities. If a host or VM experiences failure, workloads can be quickly redistributed or restarted.
