## Professional Introduction  
I am a cybersecurity enthusiast with a background in Electrical and Computer Engineering and experience in machine learning, Python, and data analysis. I am currently an **Innovation Fellow student in Cybersecurity at The Knowledge House**, where I am gaining hands-on experience in security operations and cloud security. I am focused on developing skills in cloud security and threat detection, with the goal of building a career dedicated to protecting cloud environments, systems, and data.

## Cybersecurity Focus
My primary area of interest is **Cloud Security**, with emphasis on:

- Implementing secure configurations in cloud environments (AWS)
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) 
- Monitoring cloud resources for security risks and misconfigurations
- Protecting data in the cloud through encryption and access controls

## Security Foundations: Governance & Frameworks
### CIA Triad
The CIA Triad focuses on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Confidentiality ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals. Integrity focuses on keeping data accurate and intact, preventing unauthorized modification or destruction. Availability ensures that data and systems are accessible and usable by authorized individuals whenever needed.
